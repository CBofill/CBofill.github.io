			This report analyzes the contributing factors to student financial burden at institutions of higher education in the U.S. using data of varying types aggregated from multiple sources. It implements a Random Forest Regression model of institutions and a permutation based variable importance technique. The report presents the best solution achieved, discusses its strengths and weaknesses, and scope for future work. This was the capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.
